In the case of a mailing list, you want this bounce to go back to the mailing list, not to the original author of the message; the author can't do anything about the bounce, and worse, sending the bounce back to the author can leak information about who is subscribed to the mailing list. When the mailing list gets the bounce, however, it can do something useful, such as disable the bouncing address or remove it from the list's membership.
