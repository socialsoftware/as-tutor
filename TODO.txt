  -- Topics (should be present in collapsed short view)
  --- Add topic to question

# priorities
-- Answer Time
-- Character Count
-- Quiz Date and Title
-- Save Quiz
-- Remove question from quiz

-- Show quizes that contain the Question in Question view (RITO)
-> this requires changing the import scripts and / or changing the data model in some manner

--- autosize of textareas in required screens (done but not integrated)
-- Img (currently only allows updates to questions that already have an image - does not allow adding or removing images)

# fixes
- disallow collapse of navbar so that i don't need to fix the mobile layout
-- textarea disabled color not working on pug template (may need to advance versions)
-- sort questions and answers by id


# Rui's Email
- entry point homepage
-> quiz infos list and search criterias (also summary of content -> number of quizes, questions)
- NOTE: does it make sense to present the search criteria here?
--> create new quiz and questions

- Demo - criação de um quiz.
--> endpoint (needs modifications to add new questions as well)
--> view (needs modifications to add new questions as well)
--> data submission (needs modifications to add new questions as well)

- Adicionar questão (edit quiz) -> Ideally this should stay in the quiz context
-> from database (implies having a search window and display of existing questions, insert copy)
-> (popover?)
-> create new question

- inserir pergunta previamente inserida, pesquisando por tópicos -> Ideally this should stay in the quiz context
-> add Question is not implemented
--> endpoint
--> view
--> data submission
-> topics not implemented in the interface
- (algumas inseridas como estão, as outras devem ser modificadas -> criar cópia)

- Exportação de quiz -> ArsNova (resultar no ficheiro final mesmo, e não apenas no resultado json do serviço da webAPI)
-> not fully implemented (only have the API endpoint, not downloading the actual file result that only includes the quiz json)
-) Quick win (not that quick, just redirection to a json endpoint, need to review this)
-) still returning the json in a result structure and not the actual export json

# Extra work

-> image upload when creating / editing a question
-> content search/filter for questions (adding existing questions to a quiz)
-) low priority

- gerar respostas aleatórias para uma pergunta (opcional)
-> answers only exist in the context of a question
-> this can still stay the same, it might be just a case of copying the answer into a quiz

# Questões levantadas
- Os scripts de import estão a inserir uma versão da pergunta por quiz
- Edição de uma questão no contexto de uma quiz (parece-me que deveria ser diferente de edição de uma questão sem contexto)
--> alterar todas vs criar uma cópia modificada
- comandos extras de tex nos ficheiros originais (macros definidas que depois são reutilizadas nas questões), não há parsing a ser feito

-> delete quiz and question is not implemented
- delete quiz -> delete quizhasquestions, delete questions (questionhasimage and questionhascorrectanswer cascade), delete quiz

-> save and cancel returning to previous page
- requires that the page knows what the previous page was

-> pagination for listings

# Reunião com o rui (script para a apresentação)
2018/07/04

- Make sure the content in Quiz 152 is correct
Title -> 2017-test-4-test-43B
Question 1694
Question 1695
Question 1696
Question 1697
Question 1698
(may require hammering away at the questions.tex so that it can be portable from install to install)

-> create quiz

--> Add new questions

-> Export to arsnova working as a download (maybe the button should also be in the edit quiz view)
--> Make sure the exported question works with correct answers selected (on the export)
--> missing

-> filtering list views (see -> http://api.jquery.com/filter/) (mebbe pagination -> see http://pagination.js.org/)
--> missing
--> what are bootstrap 4 datatables? and will they work for this?

-> setup instructions and deployment
--> this might be tricky (not having access to the machine may compromise this)
--> database init and configuration of webapp db
---> !Remember to change database init scripts user and password
---> Software Engineering Game/SQL/CreateDB.sql and SQL/CreateUser.sql (don't remember order)
---> Software Engineering Game/node-api/config/db.json (match user and password that was used on the database init scripts)
---> questions/python3 populateDB.py
----> required python3 modules glob, os, re, json, psycopg2, shutil, pathlib (most should be available)
----> run the command questions/python3 populateDB.py
---> Software Engineering Game/node-api/npm start (can't recall if there is anything else that needs to be done so that it stays up)

# NOTES
-> answertime init scripts (not being setup correctly)

-> list questions view, can probably be changed to be similar to how questions are displayed in quiz view

-> try and see if i can integrate the resizing textarea code

-> error handling / messages for creation / updates when saving changes (uniques mostly)

-> image is not currently being copied when duplicating questions (only the questionhasimage relation is duplicated)

-> export to arsnova having some issues
--> probably due to not using https
