1	0	It makes no sense to use views of the module viewtype, as\n    they give only a static view of the system	f
1	1	You should use only views of the component-and-connector\n    viewtype, which describe the dynamic aspects of the system	f
1	3	The only views that are relevant to performance\n     requirements are views of the Deployment style	f
2	0	Influence the software development process and its\n   management, but not the software architecture of the system under\n   development	f
2	2	Are important to determine the feasibility of the system,\n   but once we reach the conclusion that the system can be developed\n   with these restrictions, software architecture no longer depends on\n   these factors	f
2	3	Are not one of the influences of the software architecture\n   in the Architecture Business Cycle	f
3	1	The \\emph{implementation} style, which allows us to know\n    where are the artifacts that implement a certain module	f
3	2	The \\emph{layers} style, which allows us to show that the\n    structure of our system is composed of various modules that may be\n    easily reused in other systems	f
3	3	The \\emph{client-server} and \\emph{deployment} styles,\n    which allow us to isolate the required functionality in a\n    component that executes autonomously and, thus, reusable in other systems	f
4	0	To keep the current architecture of the system and optimize\n    the code to achieve the currently required performance levels	f
4	1	To change the Deployment view, replicating the server\n    component by more machines	f
4	2	To review the system's architecture so that part of the\n    computation that is currently done at the server shifts to the\n    clients	f
5	0	Those three viewtypes complement each other, but they are\n    completely independent, showing different aspects that have no\n    relation among them	f
5	1	The module and component-and-connector viewtypes are\n    independent of one another, but the allocation viewtype depends on\n    the first two	f
5	2	Each viewtype uses different software elements, such as\n    modules or components, so it does not make sense to talk about\n    relationships among these viewtypes	f
6	1	Layer 4	f
6	2	In a layered architecture all layers are equally modifiable	f
6	3	Modifiability is not made easier by a layered architecture	f
7	0	Is useful only if done (even if only partially) before the\n    system's implementation is concluded, given that the architecture\n    is used for restricting the implementation	f
7	1	Is useful only if done (even if only partially) before the \n    system's implementation is concluded, because if the system is\n    already implemented, its implementation uniquely determines the\n    architecture	f
7	2	Is useful only if done (even if only partially) before the \n    system passes all of the acceptance tests by the client, given\n    that no more requirements changes will take place after that time	f
8	0	A subset of the requirements that do not have conflicts\n     among them and that correspond to the most important business\n     goals	f
8	1	A subset of the requirements that have many conflicts\n     among them and for which you need to find tradeoffs  early in the\n     design process	f
8	3	A subset of the requirements that is chosen\n     exclusively by the architect by taking into account their\n     influence on the system's architecture	f
9	1	The \\emph{Shared data} style	f
9	2	The \\emph{Client-Server} style	f
9	3	The \\emph{Publish-subscribe} style	f

10	1	The \\emph{Pipes-and-filters} style	f
10	2	The \\emph{Peer-to-Peer} style	f
11	0	Given that the change is on execution aspects, the change\n     manifests itself only through the modification of components and\n     connectors on the system	f
11	1	This change in the way of how web applications run\n     does not correspond to any change in its architecture, because at\n     the architectural level we still have the same components	f
11	2	The only architectural change is on the Deployment view,\n     because the components and connectors remain the same, but\n     execute in different places	f

18	1	To allow the existence of more than one layer of\n    presentation logic for the same application (to provide for\n    example, an interface to web services)	f
18	2	To expose different interfaces of the domain logic layer\n    so that it allows the implementation of different layers for the\n    presentation logic	f
18	3	To facilitate the use of the data access layer by the\n    presentation logic layer	f
19	0	To implement each of the services that are executed\n    whenever the client makes a request to the server	f
19	1	To improve the server performance by maintaining a cache\n    of the objects most accessed during the processing of a client request	f
19	2	To split the computation required to process each request\n    made by the client in smaller units of work that are parallelizable	f
20	0	To improve the performance of the application server because it\n     maintains a cache of entities that reduces the number of operations\n     made on the database	f
20	1	To avoid loading a lot of data from the database when an\n     entity that has many relationships with other entities is loaded	f
20	3	To map each entity loaded by the server to the identity\n     of that entity in the database, so that the server is able to\n     update the database later, if needed	f
21	0	Stakeholders requirements do not emphasize performance as the most important issue	f
21	1	The Hadoop small development team is highly competent and skilled	f
21	3	The Hadoop system implementation uses complex distributed algorithms for scalability	f
22	0	There is a conflict between availability and performance qualities	f
22	2	There is no conflict between availability and performance qualities	f
22	3	Availability and performance qualities are ensured at deployment time only	f

23	1	Active replication, passive replication, and spare	f
23	3	Quorum, active replication, and passive replication	f
24	0	Shadow operation	f

25	2	Authenticate users, authorize users, and limit access	f
25	3	Authenticate users, authorize users, limit access, and maintain integrity	f
26	1	But they could have used the ping tactic instead, because it has the same overhead for the NameNode	f
26	2	But the exceptions tactic could have been used as well	f
26	3	To inform other DataNodes about their availability	f
27	0	Because it has a well-defined interface	f
27	1	That aggregates modules according to the uses relationship	f
27	2	Because it has a well-defined interface and hides the internal behaviour	f
28	0	Because it is a natural extension of the use cases concept	f
28	1	But it requires additional information on the modules internal structure	f
28	3	And contains all the information required to assess effectively the impact	f
29	1	The call's results may not have impact on the correct execution of the callee module	f
29	2	The call may not transfer data between the modules	f
29	3	The uses relationship requires calls to return control to the caller module	f
30	0	We should always satisfy in the first place the requirements\n      of more important stakeholders (such as the client)	f
30	1	If no order was established among them, we would not know\n      from where should we start the design process	f
30	2	If one of the stakeholders complains that his requirement\n      is not satisfied, we may explain to him that there were other more\n      important requirements first	f
31	0	The Shared data style	f
31	1	The Pipes-and-filters style	f
31	3	The Client-Server style	f
32	1	A Client-Server architecture, where the NameNode is the\n      Client and the DataNode is the Server	f
32	2	A Peer-to-Peer architecture	f
32	3	A Communicating Processes architecture	f
33	0	That view will always be incomplete without the NameNode,\n      because the HDFS Client needs to interact with it	f
33	1	That view will always be incomplete without the NameNode,\n      because the DataNode needs to interact with it	f
33	2	The view does not need to include the NameNode, but in\n      that case it will not be possible to reason about the\n      availability of the system	f
34	0	The Shared Data style	f
34	2	The Deployment style	f
34	3	The Peer-to-Peer style	f
35	0	The system would respond faster to all of the\n      clients' requests	f
35	1	The performance of the system would not change	f
35	3	The system would respond faster to requests made by\n      DataNodes to update the metadata	f
36	1	To allow the existence of more than one interface to the\n      domain logic layer (to provide, for example, an interface to web\n      services)	f
36	2	To allow the existence of different presentation logic layers	f
36	3	To facilitate the use of the data access layer by the\n      presentation logic layer	f
37	0	That should not be allowed because all interactions among\n      components must be made through the Repository	f
37	1	That is an acceptable solution if we want to reduce the\n      dependencies among the various components of the system	f
37	3	That interaction cannot be represented in this view, but\n      it may in another view of the system's architecture	f
38	0	Work Assignment views	f
38	1	Generalization views	f
38	2	Deployment views	f

2	AtrQualNegocio	\N	There are other factors that affect the development of a software\n  system, besides its functional requirements and quality attributes.\n  For example, factors such as budget or available time.  These factors	\N	t
3	Reutilizar	\N	Suppose that you are developing a new software system and that you\n  want some part of the system's functionality to be easily reusable\n  in future systems.  Which of the following architectural styles are\n  more suitable to show that the system architecture meets this\n  requirement.	\N	t
4	AumentarDesempenhoClienteServidor	\N	Suppose you have a system with a client-server architecture that was\n  designed to support the simultaneous existence of at most 100\n  clients, without specific requirements for availability.  The\n  solution adopted and put into operation four years ago is a single\n  server component to which all clients connect to.  This solution\n  satisfies the initial requirements but with the recent increase in\n  the maximum number of clients to 200, the system no longer has\n  acceptable performance.  Not knowing anything else about the\n  system's architecture, which solution do you propose to solve the\n  system's performance problems?	\N	t

8	ArchitecturalDrivers	\N	The requirements for complex systems are usually very numerous and\n  conflicting among them, making it impossible to satisfy all the\n  requirements in a given implementation of the system.  Therefore,\n  the recommended process for making the design of a software\n  architecture involves the identification of the \\emph{architectural\n    drivers} that will shape the design of architecture.  These\n  \\emph{architectural drivers} should be chosen so that they are	\N	t
9	ArqEmailMTA	\N	The email system is composed of various types of components playing\n  different roles.  For example, to send an email, a user can use a\n  program such as Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird,\n  generically designed a \\emph{mail user agent} (MUA), to compose his\n  message and send it.  To send the message, the MUA typically\n  connects to a \\emph{mail transfer agent} (MTA) that receives the\n  message, analyzes the message's headers to determine the recipients\n  and, after querying the DNS system to determine the MTA responsible\n  for each recipient, it connects to the MTAs responsible for the\n  destination addresses to deliver the message.  Each of these MTAs\n  receives the message and stores it locally or forwards it to others\n  MTAs (for example, when there are forwards or aliases configured, or\n  when the MTA that receives the message is not the ultimately\n  responsible for the email address of the recipient).\n\n  Given this simplified description of the operation of the email\n  system, which of the following architectural styles is more\n  appropriate to represent the pattern of interaction between the\n  MTAs?	\N	t
10	ArqEmailIMAP	\N	Considering yet the example of the email system, MUAs are used not\n  only to compose and to send messages, but also for users to read the\n  email messages sent to them. For this, the MUAs have to get those\n  messages from the component that stores them to show them to the\n  user.  Two different ways of doing this is by using the POP and IMAP\n  protocols.  In the first case, messages are moved from the POP\n  server to the user's computer.  In second case, the messages are\n  always stored on the IMAP server, allowing the user to access email\n  from different computers, as long as they are able to connect to the\n  same IMAP server.\n\n  Which of the following architectural styles is more appropriate to\n  represent the pattern of interaction between the MUAs and a IMAP\n  server?	\N	t
11	AlteracaoWebDois	\N	The recent developments in web applications that made them provide a\n  richer user interface led to a change in its architecture: part of\n  the application's computation has to be done in the web browser used\n  by users to access the application.  How is this change in the\n  architecture manifested in the different types of views that\n  describe the software architecture of a web application?	\N	t
12	XBoardChess	\N	Given the complexity of building a good automatic Chess player,\n  programs that play chess usually make use of existing chess engines,\n  as shown by the following excerpt from Wikipedia:\n \\begin{quote}\n    A chess engine is a computer program that can play the game of\n    chess.\n\n    Most chess engines do not have their own graphical user interface\n    (GUI) but are rather console applications that communicate with a\n    GUI such as XBoard (Linux) and WinBoard (Windows) via a standard\n    protocol.\n  \\end{quote}\n\n  In the web page for XBoard, we may read the following:\n \\begin{quote}\n    XBoard is a graphical user interface for chess [...]. It displays\n    a chessboard on the screen, accepts moves made with the mouse, and\n    loads and saves games in Portable Game Notation (PGN). It serves\n    as a front-end for many different chess services, including:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Chess engines that will run on your machine and play a game\n      against you or help you analyze, such as GNU Chess, Crafty, or\n      many others.\n    \\item [...]\n    \\end{itemize}\n  \\end{quote}\n \n  Given the above information on XBoard, chess engines, and how they\n  interact at runtime, which of the following architectural styles\n  best represents the of architecture of a software system based on\n  XBoard and one of the engines?	\N	t

Specific knowledge of the application's\n    code/internal structure and programming knowledge in general is\n    not required.  Test cases are built around specifications and\n    requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do.\n  \\end{quote}\n  \n  Assuming that you belong to the team testing a complex system and\n  that you are responsible for performing black box tests on the\n  system, which of the following architectural views of the system\n  would be most useful to you?	\N	t

Therefore, the\n  system's architect intends to develop the system such that it is\n  possible to change easily the relational database (RDBMS) component\n  used to store the application's data, replacing it with an RDBMS\n  from another manufacturer.  Given that this is a common requirement,\n  the recommended software architecture for such applications fulfills\n  this requirement by using a particular architectural style.  Which\n  style is it?	\N	t
16	GoogleAppEngine	\N	Suppose that you decided to use the Google App Engine (GAE) in the\n  development of a web application.\n\n  The GAE is described in the Wikipedia as follows:\n  \\begin{quote}\n    Google App Engine is a platform for developing and hosting web\n    applications in Google-managed data centers.\n\n    Google App Engine is cloud computing technology.  It virtualizes\n    applications across multiple servers and data centers. [...]\n\n    Google App Engine is free up to a certain level of used resources.\n    Fees are charged for additional storage, bandwidth, or CPU cycles\n    required by the application.\n  \\end{quote}\n  \n  On the other hand, the GAE documentation reads the following:\n  \\begin{quote}\n    With App Engine, you can build web applications using standard\n    Java technologies and run them on Google's scalable\n    infrastructure.  The Java environment provides a Java 6 JVM, a\n    Java Servlets interface, and support for standard interfaces to\n    the App Engine scalable datastore and services, such as JDO, JPA,\n    JavaMail, and JCache.  Standards support makes developing your\n    application easy and familiar, and also makes porting your\n    application to and from your own servlet environment\n    straightforward.\n  \\end{quote}\n\n  Taking into account these two perspectives on the GAE, which\n  architectural styles are more appropriate to represent the use of\n  GAE in the software architecture of your web application?	\N	t
17	PluginsEclipse	\N	The Eclipse IDE is an open source application written in Java, and\n  is extensible through the use of plug-ins.  In the document that\n  describes the existing plug-ins architecture in Eclipse, we may read\n  the following:\n\n \\begin{quote}\n    A plug-in in Eclipse is a component that provides a certain type\n    of service within the context of the Eclipse workbench. [...]  The\n    plug-in class provides configuration and management support for\n    the plug-in.  A plug-in class in Eclipse must extend\n    \\texttt{org.eclipse.core.runtime.Plugin}, which is an abstract\n    class that provides generic facilities for managing plug-ins.\n  \\end{quote}\n\n  Considering the model and terminology used in the course to describe\n  a software architecture, what kind of views are more appropriate to\n  represent the plug-ins architecture of Eclipse described above?	\N	t

53	HadoopMapReduceINGLES	\N	Consider the following excerpt from the tutorial on the Hadoop\n    MapReduce:\n\n    \\begin{quote}\n      Hadoop MapReduce is a software framework for easily writing\n      applications which process vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte\n      data-sets) in-parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of\n      commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner.\n\n      A MapReduce job usually splits the input data-set into\n      independent chunks which are processed by the map tasks in a\n      completely parallel manner.  The framework sorts the outputs of\n      the maps, which are then input to the reduce tasks. Typically\n      both the input and the output of the job are stored in a\n      file-system.  The framework takes care of scheduling tasks,\n      monitoring them and re-executes the failed tasks.\n    \\end{quote}\n\n    Which architectural style of the component-and-connector viewtype\n    is more adequate to describe how the MapReduce works, taking into\n    account its main advantages in solving a problem?	\N	t

How does this change manifests\n    in the software architecture of the system?	\N	t
59	MashupsINGLES	\N	One of the evolutions in the development of web applications was\n    the appearance of \\emph{mashups}, which are described in Wikipedia\n    as follows:\n\n    \\begin{quote}\n      In web development, a mashup is a web page or application that\n      uses and combines data, presentation or functionality from two\n      or more sources to create new services.\n    \\end{quote}\n\n    Knowing that the sources used by \\emph{mashups} do not know about\n    the existence of the \\emph{mashups} and that they change\n    frequently, forcing the adaptation of the \\emph{mashups} to\n    accomodate those changes, what is the best architecture to\n    minimize the effects of those changes?	\N	t

It provides the support\n      infrastructure needed for running the compiled Haskell code,\n      including the following main components:\n      \\begin{itemize}\n      \\item Memory management, including a parallel, generational, garbage collector;\n      \\item Thread management and scheduling;\n      \\item The primitive operations provided by GHC;\n      \\item A bytecode interpreter and dynamic linker for GHCi.\n      \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{quote}\n    Which system qualities are improved by the design decision of\n    creating the Runtime System, described above?	\N	t

67	ZeroMQWorkersPerCoreINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes ZeroMQ:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      The idea was to launch one worker thread per CPU core---having\n      two threads sharing the same core would only mean a lot of\n      context switching for no particular advantage.\n    \\end{quote}\n    Which architectural style is more adequate to represent the\n    information presented above?	\N	t

There are\n      two interesting aspects to how ØMQ uses the lock-free queue.\n      First, each queue has exactly one writer thread and exactly one\n      reader thread.  If there's a need for 1-to-N communication,\n      multiple queues are created.  Given that this way the queue\n      doesn't have to take care of synchronising the writers (there's\n      only one writer) or readers (there's only one reader) it can be\n      implemented in an extra-efficient way.\n    \\end{quote}\n    The architectural style that better represents the interaction\n    pattern described above is	\N	t

72	nginxEventDrivenINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes nginx:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      Traditional process- or thread-based models of handling\n      concurrent connections involve handling each connection with a\n      separate process or thread, and blocking on network or\n      input/output operations.  nginx followed a different model.  It\n      was actually inspired by the ongoing development of advanced\n      event-based mechanisms in a variety of operating systems.  What\n      resulted is a modular, event-driven, asynchronous,\n      single-threaded, non-blocking architecture which became the\n      foundation of nginx code.\n    \\end{quote}\n    The decision of turning nginx into an \\emph{event-driven},\n    \\emph{asynchronous}, \\emph{single-threaded}, and\n    \\emph{non-blocking} system was made because	\N	t

[...]  Event modules provide a particular\n      OS-dependent event notification mechanism like kqueue or epoll.\n      Protocol modules allow nginx to communicate through HTTPS,\n      TLS/SSL, SMTP, POP3 and IMAP.\n    \\end{quote}\n    Which architectural style is more adequate to represent the\n    information presented above?	\N	t
74	nginxOSOptimizationsINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes nginx:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      While handling a variety of actions associated with accepting,\n      processing and managing network connections and content\n      retrieval, nginx uses event notification mechanisms and a number\n      of disk I/O performance enhancements in Linux, Solaris and\n      BSD-based operating systems, like kqueue, epoll, and event\n      ports.  The goal is to provide as many hints to the operating\n      system as possible, in regards to obtaining timely asynchronous\n      feedback for inbound and outbound traffic, disk operations,\n      reading from or writing to sockets, timeouts and so on.\n    \\end{quote}\n    The goal of this approach used in the development of nginx was	\N	t

79	ThreeVsFourTiersINGLES	\N	The typical software architecture of an enterprise application is\n    composed of three tiers and three layers.  Yet, we may have\n    variations of this architecture.  For instance, by separating the\n    middle tier in two tiers.  In this case, which other changes exist\n    on the architecture that are related with the layers?	\N	t
80	WebLoadBalancerINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes the architecture of web\n    services:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      Another critical piece of any distributed system is a load\n      balancer.  Load balancers are a principal part of any\n      architecture, as their role is to distribute load across a set\n      of nodes responsible for servicing requests.  This allows\n      multiple nodes to transparently service the same function in a\n      system.  Their main purpose is to handle a lot of simultaneous\n      connections and route those connections to one of the request\n      nodes, allowing the system to scale to service more requests by\n      just adding nodes.\n    \\end{quote}\n    Based on this description, what is the best way to represent the\n    architecture of a system that is using a \\emph{load balancer}?	\N	t
81	DomainLogicFenixINGLES	\N	The first architecture of the Fénix system, corresponding to its\n    first years of development, could be described as a three-layered\n    architecture, typical of an enterprise application.

Which\n    architectural style is better to analyse whether the system's\n    software architecture is adequate for the planned incremental\n    releases?	\N	t

85	AvailabilityINGLES	\N	There are several tactics to satisfy availability requirements,\n    which may be applied depending on the concrete requirement that we\n    want to satisfy.  Assuming that you want to detect faults of type\n    \\emph{response} in your system, which tactic is more adequate?	\N	t
86	ChromiumDecompositionINGLES	\N	The web page that describes the architecture of Chromium OS (an\n    open source project to implement a new operating system) starts\n    like this:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      Chromium OS consists of three major components: \n      \\begin{itemize}\n      \\item The Chromium-based browser and the window manager\n      \\item System-level software and user-land services: the kernel, drivers, connection manager, and so on\n      \\item Firmware \n      \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{quote}\n    Considering this brief description of the software architecture of\n    Chromium OS, which architectural style is more adequate to\n    represent it?	\N	t

How does the use of that tactic manifests in the\n    architectural views of your system?	\N	t
88	SkeletonSystemINGLES	\N	One of the best practices in the design of a software architecture\n    is to create a skeleton system.  What is its purpose?	\N	t
89	ArqEmailMTAIMAPINGLES	\N	The email system is composed of various types of components\n    playing different roles.  For example, to send an email, a user\n    uses a \\emph{mail user agent} (MUA), to compose his message and\n    send it.  To send the message, the MUA typically connects to a\n    \\emph{mail transfer agent} (MTA) that receives the message,\n    analyzes the message's headers to determine the recipients and,\n    after querying the DNS system to determine the MTA responsible for\n    each recipient, it connects to the MTAs responsible for the\n    destination addresses to deliver the message.  Each of these MTAs\n    receives the message and stores it locally or forwards it to\n    others MTAs until the message reaches its destination MTA.\n    The recipient user of the message will then use his MUA to see the\n    messages that were sent to him.  To do it, the MUA connects to an\n    IMAP or POP server to obtain the user's messages.  Those IMAP and\n    POP servers obtain the messages for a user by reading the messages\n    stored by the MTA.\n\n    Given this simplified description of the operation of the email\n    system, which of the following architectural styles is more\n    appropriate to represent the pattern of interaction between the\n    MTA and the servers IMAP and POP?	\N	t

93	ZeroMQBrokerINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes ZeroMQ:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      It took us several years working on AMQP protocol [...] to\n      realise that there's something wrong with the classic\n      client/server model of smart messaging server (broker) and dumb\n      messaging clients.\n    \\end{quote}\n    What is the main problem, according to the authors, of the\n    \\emph{broker}-based model?	\N	t
94	ZeroMQExtensibleEnginesINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes ZeroMQ:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      The objects that handle data transfer are composed of two parts:\n      the session object is responsible for interacting with the ØMQ\n      socket, and the engine object is responsible for communication\n      with the network.  There's only one kind of the session object,\n      but there's a different engine type for each underlying protocol\n      ØMQ supports.  Thus, we have TCP engines, IPC engines, PGM\n      engines, etc.  The set of engines is extensible---in the future\n      we may choose to implement, say, a WebSocket engine or an SCTP\n      engine.\n    \\end{quote}\n    Supposing that the code implementing the \\emph{session object}\n    does not need to be changed when a new type of \\emph{engine} is\n    added to the system, which architectural views are better to show\n    this extensibility aspect of the system?	\N	t
95	ZeroMQBSDSocketsINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes ZeroMQ:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      In early versions of ØMQ the API was based on AMQP's model of\n      exchanges and queues.  I spent the end of 2009 rewriting it\n      almost from scratch to use the BSD Socket API instead.\n    \\end{quote}\n    Which requirements were targeted by this change in the system?	\N	t

The most helpful architectural view for this situation is	\N	t
96	nginxProcessesINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes nginx:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      nginx runs several processes in memory; there is a single master\n      process and several worker processes.  There are also a couple\n      of special purpose processes, specifically a cache loader and\n      cache manager.  All processes are single-threaded in version 1.x\n      of nginx.  All processes primarily use shared-memory mechanisms\n      for inter-process communication.\n    \\end{quote}\n    Assuming that you want to highlight how the various nginx\n    processes communicate among themselves, which architectural style\n    is more adequate to represent the above information?	\N	t
97	nginxCachingINGLES	\N	In the continuation of the description presented in the previous\n    question, later in the document there is this passage:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      Caching in nginx is implemented in the form of hierarchical data\n      storage on a filesystem.  Cache keys are configurable, and\n      different request-specific parameters can be used to control\n      what gets into the cache.  Cache keys and cache metadata are\n      stored in the shared memory segments, which the cache loader,\n      cache manager and workers can access.\n    \\end{quote}\n    Which architectural style is more adequate to represent the use of\n    cache in nginx?	\N	t
98	nginxWorkersINGLES	\N	As mentioned in the previous questions, the use of \\emph{workers}\n    is one of the crucial elements in the software architecture of\n    nginx.  Which of the following sentences best describes how\n    \\emph{workers} work in nginx?	\N	t

101	GHCBlockLayerINGLES	\N	The document describing the \\ghc{} presents two design decisions\n    about the development of the \\emph{Runtime System}.  The first of\n    those decisions is described like this:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      The garbage collector is built on top of a block layer that\n      manages memory in units of blocks, where a block is a multiple\n      of 4 KB in size. The block layer has a very simple API: [...].\n      This is the only API used by the garbage collector for\n      allocating and deallocating memory.  Blocks of memory are\n      allocated with \\texttt{allocGroup} and freed with\n      \\texttt{freeGroup}.\n    \\end{quote}\n    Which architectural style is more adequate to represent this\n    design decision?	\N	t
102	GHCBlockLayerQualitiesINGLES	\N	What was the main goal of the GHC's authors that led them to the\n    design decision described in the previous question?	\N	t
103	GHCRewriteRulesINGLES	\N	Some of the \\emph{architectural drivers} of the \\ghc{} are related\n    with the system's extensibility, and one of the solutions adopted\n    by its authors to provide that extensibility was the introduction\n    of \\emph{user-defined rewrite rules}, described in the document as\n    follows:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      The core of GHC is a long sequence of optimisation passes, each\n      of which performs some semantics-preserving transformation,\n      \\texttt{Core} into \\texttt{Core}.  But the author of a library\n      defines functions that often have some non-trivial,\n      domain-specific transformations of their own, ones that cannot\n      possibly be predicted by GHC.  So GHC allows library authors to\n      define rewrite rules that are used to rewrite the program during\n      optimisation.  In this way, programmers can, in effect, extend\n      GHC with domain-specific optimisations.\n    \\end{quote}\n    How does this solution manifests in the software architecture of\n    the system?	\N	t
104	GHCAsLibraryINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes the \\ghc{}:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      As the popularity of the Haskell language has grown, there has\n      been an increasing need for tools and infrastructure that\n      understand Haskell source code, and GHC of course contains a lot\n      of the functionality necessary for building these tools: a\n      Haskell parser, abstract syntax, type checker and so on.  With\n      this in mind, we made a simple change to GHC: rather than\n      building GHC as a monolithic program, we build GHC as a library,\n      that is then linked with a small Main module to make the GHC\n      executable itself, but also shipped in library form so that\n      users can call it from their own programs.  At the same time we\n      built an API to expose GHC's functionality to clients.\n    \\end{quote}\n    Which architectural diagram is more adequate to represent the\n    information presented above?	\N	t
105	GHCCodeGenerationINGLES	\N	According to the document that describes the \\ghc{}:\n    \\begin{quote}\n      Once the \\texttt{Core} program has been optimised, the process\n      of code generation begins.  The code generator first converts\n      the \\texttt{Core} into a language called \\texttt{STG}, which is\n      essentially just \\texttt{Core} annotated with more information\n      required by the code generator.  Then, \\texttt{STG} is\n      translated to \\texttt{Cmm}, a low-level imperative language with\n      an explicit stack.  From here, the code takes one of three\n      routes:\n      \\begin{itemize}\n      \\item Native code generation: [...]\n      \\item LLVM code generation: [...]\n      \\item C code generation: [...]\n      \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{quote}\n    That is, GHC may use one of three alternative code generators,\n    which have different qualities (omitted in the excerpt presented\n    above).  Supposing that you want to present an architectural\n    diagram to represent the description presented above, which one\n    seems more adequate?	\N	t

116	ArqEmailMUAMTAINGLES	\N	The email system is composed of various types of components\n    playing different roles.  For example, to send an email, a user\n    uses a \\emph{mail user agent} (MUA), to compose his message and\n    send it.  To send the message, the MUA typically connects to a\n    \\emph{mail transfer agent} (MTA) that receives the message,\n    analyzes the message's headers to determine the recipients and,\n    after querying the DNS system to determine the MTA responsible for\n    each recipient, it connects to the MTAs responsible for the\n    destination addresses to deliver the message.  Each of these MTAs\n    receives the message and stores it locally or forwards it to\n    others MTAs until the message reaches its destination MTA.\n    The recipient user of the message will then use his MUA to see the\n    messages that were sent to him.  To do it, the MUA connects to an\n    IMAP or POP server to obtain the user's messages.  Those IMAP and\n    POP servers obtain the messages for a user by reading the messages\n    stored by the MTA.\n\n    Given this simplified description of the operation of the email\n    system, which of the following architectural styles is more\n    appropriate to represent the pattern of interaction between the\n    MUA and the MTA?	\N	t

118	SecurityINGLES	\N	Suppose that you are developing a web application that keeps in a\n    database some information that is introduced by the users and that\n    one of the requirements is that the information should be kept\n    confidential, such that no one but the author of the information\n    should be able to see it (but the author may access that\n    information whenever he wants it).  How would you satisfy this\n    requirement?	\N	t
