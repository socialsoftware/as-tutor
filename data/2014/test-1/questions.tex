    \begin{quote}
        Featuritis is the tendency to trade functional coverage for quality - the more functions the earlier they're delivered, the better.
    \end{quote}

    \optionA{Featuritis may result from a requirement of the technical context.}
    \optionB{Featuritis requires the performance quality because the end user needs to execute the features.}
    \optionC{Featuritis may be a result of a requirement of the business context.}

\begin{ClosedQuestion}
    Frank Buschmann states that:
    
    \begin{quote}
        There's only one escape from such situations: architects must actively break the cycle of mutual misunderstanding and mistrust!
    \end{quote}

    \optionA{Such misunderstanding and mistrust occurs because the stakeholders have their own agendas}
    \optionB{The cycle Frank Buschmann refers to is the Architectural Influence Cycle.}

\newcommand{\qFlexibilitis}{
\begin{ClosedQuestion}
    Frank Buschmann states that:
    
    \begin{quote}
        Overly flexible systems are hard to configure, and when they're finally configured, they lack qualities like performance or security.
    \end{quote}

    \optionA{Frank Buschmann is referring to some possible consequences of the modifiability quality.}
    \optionB{Frank Buschmann are considering performance and security as the most important qualities.}
    \optionC{Frank Buschmann is referring that the consequences of a flexible system is poor performance and bad security.}

\newcommand{\qPrioritize}{
\begin{ClosedQuestion}
    Frank Buschmann states that:
    
    \begin{quote}
        Architects use flexibility as a cover for uncertainty.
    \end{quote}

    \optionA{A flexible architecture occurs when it is not possible to identify all the requirements.}
    \optionB{A solution to this problem is to prioritize the system qualities.}
    \optionC{Performance uncertainty about the system should be dealt with more flexibility.}

\newcommand{\qPerformitis}{
\begin{ClosedQuestion}
    Frank Buschmann cites the characterization Marquardt does of Performitis:
        
    \begin{quote}
        Each part of the system is directly influenced by local performance tuning measures. There is no global performance strategy, or it ignores other qualities of the system as testability and maintainability.
    \end{quote}
    
    From this problem you can conclude that:

    \optionA{Performance is a quality that you have to address at the end of the development process.}
    \optionB{There is no system which can have good performance and be easily maintainable.}
    \optionC{We have to distinguish architectural performance from opportunistic performance.}

\begin{ClosedQuestion}
    In his article, \emph{Featuritis, Performitis, and Other Deseases}, Frank Buschmann claims that:

    \optionA{Performance should be the last quality to be addressed because it is a local property of an architecture.}
    \optionB{Modifiability, flexibility, should be the first quality to be addressed because it allows the delay of architectural decisions.}
    \optionC{The lack of functionality results in a system without business value, therefore a rich set of features should be implemented first.}

\newcommand{\qArchitectureDefinition}{
\begin{ClosedQuestion}
    On the course slides you can find the following definition of architecture:
    
    \begin{quote}
        The software architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them.
    \end{quote}
    
    However, in the book you can find another definition:
    
    \begin{quote}
        The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system, which comprise the software elements, relations among them, and the properties of both.
    \end{quote}

    \optionA{The book definition does not consider relevant the externally visible properties.}
    \optionB{The book definition also considers that the properties are externally visible because they are used for reasoning by the stakeholders.}
    \optionC{The book definition also considers that the properties are externally visible because by definition an architectural property is externally visible.}

    \optionA{This shared understanding is what distinguishes architecture from design.}
